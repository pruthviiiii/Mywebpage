        As a passionate traveler, one of my favorite things to do is to explore
        the food and culture of different places. I love trying new dishes and
        learning about the history and traditions behind them. Food is such an
        integral part of any culture, and I believe that by trying local dishes,
        you can truly understand and appreciate a place and its people.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="text-left">
        But it's not just about the food itself. I also love learning about the
        history and traditions behind the dishes I try. These little bits of
        history add so much depth and flavor to the food I try, and they make
        the experience so much more meaningful.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="text-left">
        Overall, I believe that food is an essential part of any travel
        experience. It allows you to truly understand and appreciate the culture
        of a place, and it can be a delicious and exciting adventure in itself.
        I can't wait to continue exploring the world and trying all the amazing
        dishes it has to offer.

        I have always been drawn to books that offer practical tips and
        strategies for personal growth and development. Whether it's learning
        how to break bad habits, increase productivity, or improve my financial
        situation, self-help books have provided me with the knowledge and tools
        to make positive changes in my life.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="text-left">
        I also love the way that self-help books can provide inspiration and
        motivation. As someone who is always striving to be better and do
        better, I find that reading self-help books helps to keep me focused and
        on track. They provide me with the encouragement and support I need to
        overcome challenges and pursue my goals.

        Started Playing Cricket when I was a kid and ever since actively pursued
        playing cricket. I made great friends because of it and always had fun
        playing alongside so many amazing people. Cricket is my passion, and I
        absolutely love watching the game. There's something about the
        combination of skill, strategy, and athleticism that makes it so
        captivating to watch. Whether it's a tense Test match or a high-scoring
        Twenty20 game, I always find myself on the edge of my seat when I'm
        watching cricket.

        As a huge fan of speed and technology, after watching Drive to Survive
        in 2019, I became a huge fan of F1 and never missed any race. The
        incredible speeds, the cutting-edge technology, and the intense
        competition all combine to make it one of the most exciting and
        thrilling sports out there. I enjoy watching battles among the
        midfield. If you love F1, let's catch up on race weekends or include me
        in your peers.

        I started playing CS:GO as well, initially just to try it but then ended

        Ever since my childhood, I've been interested in tech, computers, etc.
        Trying different OSs was my favorite weekend thing (and completing silly
        Pok√©mon emulator games on NDS, GBA). I was always tweaking my computers
        and phones with different mods. After studying PCM for some years, I
        managed to gain admission and pursue an undergraduate degree in
        Engineering. I got hooked on JavaScript when I started coding and was
        fascinated by the ecosystem. I was lucky enough to have people support
        me in all hobbies and activities that I pursued and have had a really
        fulfilling life so far.
